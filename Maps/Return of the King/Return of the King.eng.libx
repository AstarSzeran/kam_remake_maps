0:Raising an army has proven challenging, as recent events have strained the Crown's treasuries and many of our soldiers are occupied with the task of rebuilding the nation. It would be prudent to strengthen our forces before engaging the enemy.
1:Our ally has successfully gathered a small fighting force from the surrounding villages to bolster their defenses.
2:The King has arrived with his royal guard. Pray to God that word of this does not reach the enemy, for should they learn of our presence, they may gather their strength and strike with devastating force.
3:The enemy has uncovered the true purpose of our presence here. We did not come merely to seize control of the crossing but to ensure the safety of our Majesty’s return to his homeland. We cannot permit them to capture our beloved King—or, worse, end his life.
4:Our allies are being slaughtered! Their forces are suffering devastating losses, and it’s only a matter of time before their line breaks.

99:The recent natural disaster had thrown the kingdom into disarray, devastating the countryside and displacing thousands. Though his journey to the holy land was still possible, the King sought to return home to provide leadership, aid, and moral support to his subjects in their time of need. Yet fate had other plans.||Most of the kingdom's fragile wooden bridges have been washed away, leaving the mighty Land Bridge as the only remaining path across the great river. But this critical crossing is controlled by the armies of a longstanding rival—a sworn enemy of the crown—who would never allow the King's passage without a fight.||Across the river lies a humble village of stone masons and farmers—our loyal allies in this struggle. They have begun preparations to support the royal cause, fortifying their position and training a modest militia. Their efforts are admirable, but their numbers are few, and time is running out.||Above all, the King's presence must remain a secret. If the enemy learns that he has taken refuge in the village, they will surely launch a swift and deadly assault, endangering the King's life and plunging the kingdom into even greater turmoil.||We must act quickly and decisively to seize control of the Land Bridge before the enemy can strengthen their position or discover the King's movements. His safety and the future stability of the realm hang in the balance.
