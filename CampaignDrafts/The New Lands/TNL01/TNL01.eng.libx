1: The enemy allows us to overthink our strategy; but in troth, they want us to raise the white flag indeed. Thou must needs use this precious time to prepare thy troops, for we shall not yield!
2: Our scouts report that the enemy doth prepare for battle and shalt attack soon indeed. Show them no mercy!
3: Now that we openly attacked our enemies and even killed one of their men, they shall no longer hold their attack and strike immediately.
4: We have survived the onslaught on our city thanks to thy performance. Now it is our turn to attack; do not doubt on the way to victory!
