1: The enemy knows of our presence, and wilt, now that we are critically weakened, launch an attack immediately.
2: Well done!The enemy is located in the villages nigh to the north, which once belonged to the Castellan and are preparing to storm the castle. But there doth be good news: thanks to former trade between the Castellan and his homeland, he hath large stocks of unused iron, iron ore and coal in his storehouses. He hath given some of it to us. Use it thankfully!
3: Your highness; reinforcements have arrived, just in time to fight in the great battle at hand. We must show our faithfulness to Castellan Baruch by fighting side by side with the castle's defenders!
4: The hour of truth hath come! The King's forces have arrived and will soon strike upon our ally. We must help them as much as we can!
5: Thanks to our combined efforts, the castle has been secured... for now at least. Once we regain our strength, it is time to free the neighbouring vilages. Remember to spare the innocent villagers and focus on the King''s soldiers.
