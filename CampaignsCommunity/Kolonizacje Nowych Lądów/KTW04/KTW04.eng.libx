MAXID:1

0: My lord, after the warehouse was destroyed, our men found some useful resources there.
1: In the far north, a great battle is raging between the people of the south and the people of the east. So we must use their battle to weaken their forces as much as possible and conquer new lands. Be aware that the 3 tyrant's units are placed everywhere, which will make it difficult for us to travel to the north.
