Mission 13: In Dire Straits||The Stadtholder hath met the executioner! But before the axe touched his neck, he warned us that 'it is not yet over'... What he meant by this remains to be seen.|Now we try to trace ye Iron Guard, so that we can meet up and fight united against the rouge King. Unfortunately, the King hath foreseen this, and sent a strong army that hath surrounded us in a tactical maneuver. Enemy crossbowmen have occupied the mountains to make us immobile. The good news is that some battalions of ye Rebels have reached us and will help us fight! They will cover our back while we defend the front. If we survive the first battle, taking out the crossbowmen should be easy.
