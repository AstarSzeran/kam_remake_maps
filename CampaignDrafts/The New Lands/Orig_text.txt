Mission1: Build a town Our scouts report that the Castellan|and the King have set up camp nigh|to thy north, and even now their|armies are preparing to attack thee!|Thou must needs sustain the attack|and strike back as soon as thou can.|If thou waits too long, thine enemy's|settlements shall become too well|fortified for thou to crush with ease. 
Mission2: Thou hast done well, but it is not yet|time to revel in thy victory. Thou|must needs search further afield to|locate ye Rebels. Thou first crosses ye bridge to the north, and here|thou shouldst find a village of the|Castellan. Destroy it! 
Mission3: At last! The Rebels have been contacted! They hide in a cave to the east, nigh south from an important city of ye Castellan. The Rebels' shelter is safe, but their position hath indeed been discovered by thine enemies. They|also have trouble with food, for|they have been disconnected from|their stocks. In troth this means|thou must make haste, for ye|Rebels' hours are numbered! The enemy may decide to attack at any|moment, so it wilt be wise to place|some battalions near thy ally. We|must protect them at all costs! 
Mission4: The Rebels hath told us about a|fortress, far from ye Rebels' shelter.|If we help defending it, the Rebels will|help us with our food problem. Thou|must travel across the western bridge,|to the region that doth belong to ye|Stadtholder. Although we believed to|have temporarily disposed of ye|Castellan, he hath indeed sent a huge|army to make his revenge. Together|with the guards of ye Stadtholder|they shall be a dangerous opponent.|Stop their armies and kill the guards! 
Mission5: Heavy rain hath fallen on the region|belonging to ye Stadtholder, and this|shalt indeed be a disadvantage to|thee. However we are blessed with|good fortune. Veins of rich gold have|been discovered, and this suits us|most admirably, for thou gold supplies|art indeed running low. To thy|north-east lies a city of ye Stadtholder,|and he is constructing a second one|to thy north. Because ye Stadtholder|is unaware of our presence, thou|shouldst be able to destroy it with|ease. However, thou must beware,|for his scouts are everywhere,|looking for the guards that have not|returned, and it shalt not be long|before thou art in troth discovered! 
Mission6: It seems not strange that the|Stadtholder protects this area well,|for gold is in ample supply. Ye rain|hath not eased, and this is good for|him. The area hath flooded leaving us|no place to defend ourselves! 
Mission7: Our scouts have found a disused|woodcutters village which thou canst|inhabit. Iron ore hath also been|spotted in the surrounding|mountains. A company of Rebels|have sneaked past ye enemies|defenses to join us. Unfortunately,|the Rebels were not careful enough|and the Stadtholder's men have|discovered their doing. They have|put barricades, stopping further|Rebels from passing, and shall do|anything to keep them standing. Thy|mission is to kill all of ye|Stadtholder's dastardly troops, so|that ye Rebels can once more unite|with thee. 
Mission8: We have finally arrived at the|fortress of ye Rebels, but the|situation doth not look good. The|enemy is stronger than expected,|and it shalt be hard to achieve|victory. However, the situation|takes a turn and gives us a new|opportunity. The King hath betrayed|ye Castellan and now attacks his|forces from behind. If thou canst|make sure that the second army of|ye Castellan survives, the remaining|soldiers may report to the Castellan|that thou art helping him, and so|might we gain a new ally. 
Mission9: Some of the Castellan's soldiers|have indeed reported the days|events. The remaining troops have|joined our forces, to thank us for|our help. Because we lost so much|time, the King's soldiers have already|broken through the Rebels'|defensesâ€¦ 
Mission10: Jean Catrot hath, as promised, sent|an excess of food to our homeland in|return for thy help. We cannot|retreat though, because without|these fruitful lands, verily there shalt|indeed be another famine. We must|needs maintain our alliances and|stop the King, who doth be preparing|a large assault on the castle. By|doing so, we can show our|faithfulness to Castellan Baruch!|Recapture the two villages nigh to|the north, which once belonged to|the Castellan. Spare ye innocent|villagers. 
Mission11: We have given ye Castellan a portion|of our gold supplies, for he helped us|when our hour of need was nigh. The|Castellan hath reported that there|doth be gold veins in plenty to thy|north-east: the region of ye|Stadtholder. Unfortunately we have|taken the wrong path, which hath in|troth lead us to a dangerous place:|the border that doth divide the lands|of ye Stadholder with the lands of|the King. Take caution, for enemies|are everywhere. 
Mission12: We continue our journey east, to|where the last stronghold of ye|Stadtholder is located. Rumour has|it that this city was constructed|strategically, on a mountain full of|gold veins, surrounded by a wall of|hills with only two passages in. The|situation is worse because ye|Stadtholder hath hired mercenaries.|Also, his great wealth allowed him to|bribe the highwaymen nigh to the|south-east! These rascals are hiding|everywhere. Stay on thy guard,|capture the city, and kill ye|Stadtholder! 
Mission13: The Stadtholder hath met the|executioner! But once again, thou|must needs be careful: before he|died he warned us that it is not yet|over. Now we try to trace ye Iron|Guard, so that we can meet up and|fight united against the rouge King.|Unfortunately, the King hath|foreseen this, and sent a strong|army that hath surrounded us in a|tactical maneuver. The good news|is that some battalions of ye Rebels|have reached us and will help us|fight! 
Mission14: Well done! Thou hast escaped from|the King's cunning trap! We shall|now travel to the north-west,|because ye Iron Guard hath been|spotted nigh to there. They have|attacked an important fortress which|doth belong to the King, but they did|not succeed in breaking through the|multiple defense lines. Whilst they|prepare for the final march, we shall|continue the attack on the fortress.||An avalanche hath exposed a stone|wall to us, which is why we are split|up. The storehouse nigh to the|north-east is very important for us,|and the enemy doth know that!|Thou must make haste! 
Mission15: We have captured the fortress of the|King, and to win this war, we must|needs only destroy the few who still |resist. However, an enormous army|of peasants, rebels and soldiers have|turned against us and the Iron|Guard. They fight under a purple|banner: the banner of ye Stadholder!|Because we have a large force at our|disposal, thou must needs take thy|time positioning it; the rest of the|Iron Guard are doomed anyway... 
Mission16: King Kabos hath underestimated us.|Verily, did he not expect us to come|this far. But we are here: his last|bastion. Victory is near, but as|always thou must needs be careful.|Although the King's forces are|weakened and thou canst rely on thy|stalwart ally, thou shouldst make not|the same mistake as the King. Do not|underestimate thy enemy! Kabos|shalt be more cunning than ever now|that all of his tactics have failed.|Besides, we do not have any|information about the enemy at this|point. Let none bear the black|banner!
??idk, is it part of the Mission16 start text or no?? Mission16: Congratulations, thou hast|accomplished "The New Lands"!
