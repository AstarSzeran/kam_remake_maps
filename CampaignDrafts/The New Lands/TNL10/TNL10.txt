Mission 10: Struggle for Survival||Thankfully we were succesful in helping the Rebels. Though their military force has diminished and they will need much time to recover, the leader of ye Rebels hath, as promised, sent an excess of food to our homeland. However, we cannot retreat now, because without these fruitful lands, verily there shalt indeed be another famine. There is only one path for us: we must needs maintain our alliances and stop the Stadtholder and the King.|Meanwhile, the King has revealed his true plan: it seems that the attack on the Rebel's fortress was not only meant to dispose of the Rebels, but also to weaken the Castellan's forces. Before his putrid treason towards the Castellan, The King ordered Castellan Baruch to send most of his elite troops, the 'Iron Guard', away to train in the northern forests. It can be no coincidence, now that the Castellan's forces are weakened and his elite troops are not present, that the King prepares a large assault on the castle!|We must show our faithfulness to Castellan Baruch by fighting side by side with the castle's defenders. Once we fended off the attack, we must recapture the two villages nigh to the north, which once belonged to the Castellan. Spare ye innocent villagers.
