1: Two barons have joined forces and are waiting for our attack in the south. Let's not give up!
2: The barbarians have entrusted us with many of their people. You just need to equip them with axes! (To make a barbarian, start building in the stronghold and make a soldier. Barbarian cost: 6 axes and 1 recruit)
3: People! Watch out for the constantly falling stones from the mountains! They have killed more than one here!
