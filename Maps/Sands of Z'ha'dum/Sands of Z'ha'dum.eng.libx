0:Blinded by hubris, the Sultan has only now begun ordering the construction of defenses around the gold veins. We must strike before their fortifications are completed!
1:The Sultan did not anticipate our swift action and left their gold supplies in the east lightly guarded. We must strike quickly before they have a chance to strengthen their defenses!
2:The Sultan is as cunning as he is cruel. Our initial intelligence indicated only light defenses at his outpost, but they were clearly reinforced well before our arrival. Still, we have no choice but to press forward.
3:We've destroyed the Sultan's outpost and claimed the gold veins for the kingdom. This victory secures vital resources and weakens the enemy at the same time.
4:While completing the construction of a new gold mine, our workers uncovered a hidden stash of weapons in an old mining shaft. They have been transported to our barracks to strengthen our forces for the battles ahead.
5:As we finished work on a new mine, one of our laborers uncovered a hidden stash of weapons in an old shaft. These have been moved to our storehouse for future use.

99:The Crownlands of our kingdom have long suffered under the shadow of Sultan Malak ibn Rahim's relentless ambition. His repeated violations of our borders and threats to our citizens have proven his ruthlessness. Such acts of barbarity cannot and will not go unanswered.||A direct engagement with his main host would be costly. Our first move must be strategic: a swift strike on his lightly defended outpost in the East. This position is vital to his supply chain, his control over the surrounding region, and home to rich veins of gold. Capturing it will disrupt his logistics, deprive him of resources, and grant us strategic footholds.||Once secured, we will focus on his stronghold in the North to further divide his forces, weaken his influence, and eliminate his ability to threaten our lands. The Crown will not bow to his threats. The cost of crossing our borders will be his to pay.
