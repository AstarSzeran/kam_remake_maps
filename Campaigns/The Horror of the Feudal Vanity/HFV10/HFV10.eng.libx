0:The encircled army loses its strength, 6 armies are advanced to help it, but they are widely scattered from each other, and the enemy has better positioning. For a successful breakthrough to the stronghold, you must try to unite the armies. Do not waste time, the enemy will soon begin to strike in all directions.
1:The main unit is blocked in the intermountain in the southwest, the enemy is waiting for reinforcements in the defense and will not allow us to break through to the allied units.
