0:We should expect an attack from the north very soon. We better prepare some defence or they will most likley be able to destroy us.
1:Soon there will be more frequent attacks from the north. They are equipping more and more soldiers. We really need that iron deposits on top or we well be screwed!
2:It seems like the green village from the other side of the river is now also preparing for an attack. They also seem to have stronger soldiers. If we keep going, we will certainly get the attention of the other villages as well.
10:Since the 6 kingdoms have allied, the surrounding villages have been exploited even more than before. Men who had previously provided for the upkeep of their families are used as slaves. In addition to famine, civil war is threatening. We should stop them before it is too late. It will not be easy. Each kingdom uses different tactics. Our next opponent has occupied the local iron deposits, so we will probably be forced to rely only on leather units for the time being until we have eliminated them.||Special thanks goes to Strangelove for providing me his script for improved AI (+ mapname :D).|Make sure to check out his maps and campaign!
