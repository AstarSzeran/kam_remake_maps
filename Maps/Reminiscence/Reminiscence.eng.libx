0:Years long war which devastated the country finally came to an end. Conflict lasted so long that roads among abandoned regions ceased to exist causing bandits and ranegade warchiefs to begin their rule of terror. But now all of it will change. Our first goal will be cleansing the land of Lordmidia, known for its plentiful resources and arable land. Settlements in those lands all got destroyed and in their place appeared camps under leadership of the warchief known as Krenon. Use your strategic skill to reclaim the region for the crown! ||[$0707FF]Difficulty Rating:[] **||Map uses [$E1FA6B]Strangelove's[] improved AI script.|Map uses [$7A7AEB]Cmowla's[] Anti Lure script (4.3b).
1:We arrived in Lordmidia. Enemies are close but they are not ready to fight just yet, giving us some time to expand our base and prepare more troops to fend of their assaults. Use this time wisely.
2:It would appear that Krenon's troops are mobilizing quite quickly. While his main army is still not ready to attack us, the scouts is already prepared and soon will start performing skirmishes against us. Stay sharp and repel all that shall came at you!
3:Ground trembles and the battle cries can be heard from the north. Main force of Krenon's army is ready to go. It's time for the true test, survive and defeat the enemy, or fall and be remembered as a failure.
