1: Our previously dispatched engineers have already built the bridges! Baron Naucher guards the small port we need to help the king's son. We absolutely have to take him back!
2: We sent scouts to discover some terrain.

4: Lord, we are so cold in these armor. We don't have something warmer to wear?
