Mission 15: A Last Stance||Thanks to our formidable spy, we have gained an advantage for the final battle. However, the time has not yet come, for an enormous army of peasants, rebels and soldiers have turned against us and the Iron Guard. They fight under a purple banner: the banner of ye Stadholder! These rascals must want to avenge the death of their leader and are now used by the King as a human shield. Their numbers will be overwhelming, so be prepared!

Iron Guard commander: "Brave soldiers, here on this very mountain peak we will finally find our resting place. Here, where it is almost too cold to hold our weapons, we will bleed and freeze... But not before we made our final stand, and took as many of them with us as we can! There is no retreat! There is no surrender! Death to the King!

Mount Arvesh
On top of the mountains of Arvesh, the Iron Guard was ultimately defeated after a fierce, heroic battle.
