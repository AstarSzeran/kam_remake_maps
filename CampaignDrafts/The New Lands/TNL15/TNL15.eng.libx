1: Iron Guard commander: "Brave soldiers, here on this very|mountain peak we will finally find our resting place. Here,|where it is almost too cold to hold our weapons, we will bleed|and freeze...
2: But not before we made our final stand, and took as|many of them with us as we can! There is no retreat!|There is no surrender! Death to the King!"
3: Finally Thou hath found the Iron Guard and their brave commander. But The Iron Guard is beyond our reach. These brave warriors, surrounded on a hill, will fight to the bitter end. Thou must focus on thy own survival.
