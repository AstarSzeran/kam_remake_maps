1: Get to the castle quickly and get ready to defend it! The baron's troops don't know pity.
2: Lord, unfortunately we can't rebuild the walls of this castle. Our engineers are not well trained for such tasks.
3: The Baradaug Army is about to come out on top of us! Prepare people to defend themselves! Let the will of heaven be done!
