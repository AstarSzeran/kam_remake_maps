(In PDF is it 15 min) 18 min. is a good checkpoint to start with recruits and towers.||-Remove roadscript, if you place a beacon on your own road it will vanish, you wil get 1 stone back into you main warehouse, for each stone witch you delete.||-Traffic controlscript, enables you to control the traffic in the in and outway of your castle. Your serfs will die after bringing 1 item and will respammed out of the back of your castle.||It causes a little disadvantage into the stats:|The lost serfs will displayed into the|'lost citizens bar'.|It was the only way to solve it, sorry for this issue.|But it works great!!!||If you wanna control the backtraffic, simply build a road into a direction you wish, and the serfs will follow automatically that road/way. If you don't do that, the the serfs will choose random directions and walk over the whole place.||You can turn on the trafficscript by clicking the repair mode on in castle. To turn of: disable repairmode in castle.||Credits:|Special to [LLL] Diedes /wrote the script.|(Scriptidea by LLL-Clan)||Good luck and have fun!!!||Leadtext V. 3.91||After many requests, and feedback we have decided to bring out a official new release.... Proudly we presents: A Secret Zone LLL FFA V 3.91 AI!!||Changes V 3.91:|-Storehouses are connected, because it's now playable for CPU/AI players too. Now you can play practice/human games VS or with CPU/AI players. They can't play with seperated storhouses.||Changes V 3.9:|-The south side of loc 7 is mirrored, so it's easier to set up forest.|-South/west space at loc 8 is little decreased to fine balance space in comparison with other locs.|-Fishgrounds on locs 1-2 are moved from the southside to the northside, this is done to balance the distance between storehouses and fishgrounds in comparison with other locs.|-It happens very often that you have a lack of gold in long games. After many requests, to solve/delay this problem: We have added, a second storehouse with 600 coal and 600 goldore on each loc. It's the same ammount in the mountains, means plus 1200 goldchests. we have 2 reasons for a second storehouse: 1st, to avoid/prevent a trafficjam in the front of your storehouse. 2st, to maintain the space for each loc for building a big eco/village.      -We have special chosen for goldore and coal and not for finished goods/goldchests, because otherwise it's to easy to use the gold. You must still plan and working for your gold. But keep in mind this is still a LIMITED supply of gold NOT UNlimited.....||Good Luck and have Fun!!!! Greetz from the LLL-Clan ||Changes V 3.8:                       Some landscape fixes. And Locs are more finebalanced in space||Changes V 3.7:                   After some feedback: Some landscape fixes on loc 5:            River and mountains in the north are increased in width because the enemy could burn down the coal and ironmines from the outside side from the loc. This problem is fixed now.                                          -After the one entrance upgrade (V 3.6), loc 6 is fully redesigned. This is done after some feedback too, (the bad placement of the storehouse in compare with other locs). Now the placement of the storehouse is fixed/improved enough, in compare with the other locs.||Changes V 3.6:                     -All locs have more stonepieces (plus 200)= total 1530 pieces Approx.                                 -Loc 5-6 are increased in space -Max. towercount is set from 10 to 5 max. because you have now 1 side to defend instead of two.                                     -After many feedback we have decided to give all locs 1 entrance instead of 2.
