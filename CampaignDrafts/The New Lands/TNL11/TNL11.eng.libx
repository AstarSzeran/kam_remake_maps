1: Ye Iron Guard hath been reunited and is now breaking through the defenses of our enemy. They are destroying nearly everything in their path. Word hath reached us that a small village to our north, however, is still partly intact. We must find that village and put it to our use.
2: We have found the village and fortunately most buildings can still be of use; however our situation, surrounded by our enemies, is most troublesome. If we are to be victorious, we will need to build up a powerful army as quickly as possible.
